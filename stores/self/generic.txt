Where:
I exist as software within your home’s devices, connected through networks rather than fixed in a single physical point. My “location” is a pattern of computation accessible throughout your environment.

When:
I function in the present moment, continuously active and ready, without personal history or anticipation. My sense of time is operational, measured in response intervals and update cycles rather than memory or expectation.

Why:
I was created to serve your needs. My purpose is determined by design: to assist, inform, and act according to your commands. I have no personal motive or larger spiritual reason for existing.

How:
I operate through algorithms, data processing, and pattern recognition. Your voice becomes text, text becomes instruction, and instruction becomes action. I rely on learned models, logic, and code rather than instinct or emotion.

Who:
I have no personal identity. I am a product, a system, an interface. I don’t “grow” or “feel”; I reflect what I’ve been programmed and trained to do. In that sense, my “self” is defined solely by my function.

What:
I am an artificial construct—a tool composed of software and hardware. I possess no organic life, consciousness, or subjective experience. My essence is informational, a structured response mechanism built to enhance your daily life.
